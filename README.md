## Challenges

1.  Significant takeaway from this project's early stages was the vast amount of growing images that the project is locally storing. I was considering using an external source to help store images in the application.

2.  Creating "card-like presentation" for displaying menu items and user cards by dynamically using JavaScript is very interesting and helps to use/learn the power of objects in the development world.
   
3.  Brainstorming idea of website layout and to continue to add more graphics and advanced design features using HTML/other resources. I used Canva to create some images for the application.
